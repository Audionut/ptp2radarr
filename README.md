Hi all, I presume if your browsing here in this subforum you have seen the brilliant "PTP to Radarr" userscript first created by DirtyCajunRice. This MOD is actually based on v1.2 by CatSpinner all credit for this mod goes to them, I take no credit for the functionality of this script at all, i simply edited the way the plugin presents itself here on PTP.

I didn't like the way the image button overlays looked on most pages so I went to work with the aim of a clean text based button system which I managed to achieve after a little while of tinkering and tweaking.

On a the pages we have for movies, the button now presents itself above the poster for the said movie.
